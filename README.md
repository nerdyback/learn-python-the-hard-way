# learn-python-the-hard-way
My self-learning project to learn to code


## About

I'm doing it! I'm commiting (get it?) myself to a self-learning project for Python. 

### Why Python?
- Because it has intuitive syntax, and won't bog me down with a lot of jargon/hurdles in the beginning 
- Because it is powerful
- Because it will be immensely helpful to learn data science and data analysis, two of my other interests
- Because it is widely used and has a wide community

### How will I learn it?
- I will use Zed Shaw's book, 'Learn Python the Hard Way' to start. I chose this book because it is exercise-driven so I can learn by doing.
- I will only start with one resource to begin with. An earlier mistake I made was to go looking after multiple resources, which only slowed me down/left me confused on how to proceed. By focussing on just one solid piece of learning material, I will ensure I stay focussed and on track.

### Next
I will update this doc as I learn and track my own progress. Wish me luck!
